**Rationale**:
- Union types perfect for message content (text/audio/image)
- Automatic JSON serialization for API communication
- Immutable classes prevent accidental state mutations
- Copy-with methods for easy state updates
- Built-in equality and toString methods

**Alternatives considered**:
- json_annotation only (missing immutability and union types)
- built_value (more verbose, less Flutter-focused)
- Manual serialization (error-prone, maintenance overhead)

### 7. File Management and Persistence

**Decision**: File package v7.0.1 with local file system for media files  
**Rationale**:
- Pluggable abstraction allows easy testing with in-memory FS
- Consistent API across platforms
- Proper error handling and edge case management
- Mockable for unit testing without file system dependencies

**Integration approach**:
- Store media file paths in Isar database
- Use File package for actual file operations
- Implement cleanup routines for orphaned files

### 8. Navigation and Routing

**Decision**: Use go_router v16.2.1 with go_router_builder v4.0.1 for type-safe routing  
**Rationale**:
- Declarative navigation based on Navigation 2.0 API
- Deep linking support crucial for mobile app URL handling
- Type-safe route generation eliminates runtime navigation errors
- Compile-time parameter validation and autocompletion
- Built-in support for nested routes, guards, and redirects
- Perfect for multi-screen app with configuration, thread management

**Code Generation Features**:
- `@TypedGoRoute` annotations generate type-safe route classes
- Automatic parameter parsing (path, query, extra parameters)
- Generated `go()`, `push()`, and `location` methods
- Support for enums, custom types, and optional parameters
- Shell routes for persistent UI elements (bottom nav, app bar)

**Route Structure for App**:
```dart
@TypedGoRoute<HomeRoute>(path: '/')
class HomeRoute extends GoRouteData with $HomeRoute {
  @override
  Widget build(context, state) => const HomeScreen();
}

@TypedGoRoute<ConfigRoute>(path: '/config')
class ConfigRoute extends GoRouteData with $ConfigRoute {
  @override
  Widget build(context, state) => const ConfigurationScreen();
}

@TypedGoRoute<ThreadRoute>(path: '/thread/:threadId')
class ThreadRoute extends GoRouteData with $ThreadRoute {
  const ThreadRoute({required this.threadId});
  final String threadId;
  
  @override
  Widget build(context, state) => ChatScreen(threadId: threadId);
}
```

**Alternatives considered**:
- Named routes (string-based, error-prone at runtime)
- auto_route (good but more complex setup)
- routefly (less mature, smaller ecosystem)
- Manual navigation (verbose, no deep linking support)

### 9. Share-to-App Integration

**Decision**: Use share_plus v12.0.0 + share_handler v0.0.25 for bidirectional sharing  
**Rationale**:
- Share Plus handles outgoing shares (copy/share generated content)
- Receive Sharing Intent captures incoming shared files from other apps
- Supports both single files and multiple file sharing
- Proper MIME type handling for audio/image filtering
- Cross-platform support with native integration

**Implementation approach**:
- Register app as share target for audio/* and image/* MIME types
- Handle incoming shares by creating new thread with attached content
- Support batch processing of multiple shared files
- Maintain share history and duplicate detection

**Alternatives considered**:
- Native share intents (platform-specific implementation)
- Custom URL schemes (limited to text, no file support)
- Deep linking (doesn't handle file sharing)

### 10. Background Processing and Permissions

**Decision**: Implement proper background audio with permission management  
**Rationale**:
- Critical for voice-first experience - users need continuous recording
- Proper battery optimization handling
- User-friendly permission requests with clear explanations
- Fallback modes when background access denied

**Background Recording Strategy**:
- Android: Foreground service with persistent notification
- iOS: Background audio capability with proper entitlements
- Permission flow: Microphone → Background → Storage
- Battery optimization whitelist guidance for users
- Graceful degradation to foreground-only mode

**Alternatives considered**:
- Foreground-only recording (poor UX for voice-first app)
- Background without notification (violates platform guidelines)
- Always-on recording (privacy and battery concerns)

### 10. Performance Optimization

**Decision**: Implement lazy loading and efficient state management  
**Rationale**:
- Large thread lists need pagination/virtualization
- Audio/image files should be loaded on-demand
- Riverpod's automatic caching reduces redundant API calls
- Isar's indexing provides fast query performance
- Shared file handling requires efficient processing

**Implementation strategy**:
