## 1. Architecture Evolution & Decisions

### Initial Vision vs Final Architecture

**Started with**: Traditional service-based Flutter architecture  
**Evolved to**: Feature-based architecture with heavy code generation

#### Key Architectural Shifts:
1. **Service Pattern → Riverpod 3 Class Notifiers**
   - Eliminated singleton services
   - Embraced `@riverpod` class-based providers
   - Direct API calls from blocs instead of service abstraction

2. **Freezed → dart_mappable**
   - Switched for better customization and performance
   - Cleaner code generation with less boilerplate
   - Better support for complex serialization scenarios

3. **Monolithic → Feature-Based Structure**
   ```
   lib/features/
   ├── configuration/ (models, bloc, widgets, utils)
   ├── threads/       (models, bloc, widgets, utils)
   ├── chat/          (models, bloc, widgets, utils)
   ├── modes/         (models, bloc, widgets, utils)
   └── media/         (models, bloc, widgets, utils)
   ```

### Architecture Principles That Emerged:
- **Minimalistic Models**: 3-4 fields max, only UI-exposed data
- **Feature Isolation**: Each feature completely self-contained
- **Code Generation First**: Prefer generated code over manual implementation
- **Direct API Integration**: No service layer abstraction between blocs and APIs

---

## 2. Technology Stack Learnings

### Core Dependencies (Final Selection)

#### State Management: flutter_riverpod 3.0+
**Why chosen over alternatives:**
- Built-in code generation with `@riverpod`
- Automatic provider disposal and lifecycle management
- Type-safe dependency injection
- Better testing support than Provider/Bloc

#### Data Models: dart_mappable 4.6+
**Why chosen over Freezed:**
- More flexible code generation
- Better performance characteristics  
- Cleaner API for complex serialization
- Less verbose generated code

#### Database: isar_community 3.3+
**Why chosen over alternatives:**
- NoSQL flexibility perfect for chat messages
- Excellent Flutter performance
- Built-in code generation
- Strong query capabilities

#### AI Integration: openai_dart 0.5+
**Critical learning**: Use the same LLM for transcription
- Ensures compatibility with custom OpenAI-compatible APIs
- No dependency on specific transcription services
- Predictable cost model (single API)
- Works with local/custom model deployments

### Navigation: go_router 16.2+ with go_router_builder
**Key insight**: Type-safe routing prevents runtime errors
```dart
@TypedGoRoute<ThreadRoute>(path: '/thread/:threadId')
class ThreadRoute extends GoRouteData with $ThreadRoute {
  const ThreadRoute({required this.threadId});
  final String threadId;
}
```

## 3. AI Integration Insights

### Multi-Modal Processing Strategy

**Critical Decision**: `transcribeAudioFirst` configuration flag
- **Default: true** - Transcribe audio to text first, then process with text-based modes
- **Alternative: false** - Send audio directly to multi-modal models

#### Benefits of Transcription-First Approach:
1. **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any OpenAI-compatible API
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Avoids expensive multi-modal model calls for transcription
3. **Flexibility**: Users can choose based on their model capabilities
4. **Fallback Strategy**: Graceful handling when models don't support audio

#### Implementation Pattern:
```dart
// Step 1: Transcribe using same LLM
final transcriptionRes = await client.createChatCompletion(
  request: CreateChatCompletionRequest(
    model: ChatCompletionModel.modelId(config.modelName),
    messages: [
      ChatCompletionMessage.developer(
        content: 'Transcribe the following audio to text...',
      ),
      ChatCompletionMessage.user(
        content: ChatCompletionUserMessageContent.parts([
          ChatCompletionMessageContentPart.audio(/* audio data */),
        ]),
      ),
    ],
  ),
);

// Step 2: Process transcribed text with selected mode
```

### OpenAI API Usage Patterns

**Key Learning**: Use `openai_dart` package correctly
- `OpenAIClient` for initialization
- `CreateChatCompletionRequest` for structured requests
- `ChatCompletionMessage.developer()` for system prompts (not `.system()`)
- `ChatCompletionUserMessageContent.parts()` for multi-modal content

## 4. Feature Design Philosophy

### Minimalistic Model Approach

**Core Principle**: Only expose fields that the UI actually needs

#### Model Field Limits:
- **Configuration**: `apiKey`, `baseUrl`, `modelName`, `transcribeAudioFirst` (4 fields)
- **Thread**: `id`, `name`, `createdAt`, `messageCount` (4 fields)
- **Message**: `id`, `content`, `timestamp`, `type` (4 fields)
- **Mode**: `id`, `name`, `prompt`, `isDefault` (4 fields)
- **MediaAttachment**: `path`, `type`, `size` (3 fields)

#### Benefits:
- Faster development iteration
- Easier testing and debugging
- Clear separation of concerns
- Room for future expansion without breaking changes

### Code Generation Strategy

**Philosophy**: Generate everything possible, write as little manual code as needed

#### Generated Components:
1. **Models**: `dart_mappable` mappers and serialization
2. **State Management**: `@riverpod` providers and notifiers
3. **Routing**: `go_router_builder` type-safe routes
4. **Database**: `isar_community` collections and queries

#### Manual Components (Kept Minimal):
- Business logic in bloc methods
- UI widgets and layouts
- Utility functions
- Integration glue code

## 5. Testing Strategy Insights

### TDD Approach for Flutter

**Critical Learning**: Tests must be written and fail BEFORE implementation

#### Test Organization:
```
test/
├── features/           # Widget tests per feature
├── integration/        # End-to-end user flows
├── golden/            # UI consistency tests
└── performance/       # Audio/AI response time tests
```

#### Parallel Testing Strategy:
- **[P] marker**: Tasks that can run in parallel
- Feature isolation enables maximum parallelization
- Different files = parallel execution
- Same file = sequential execution

### Test Categories:
1. **Widget Tests**: UI behavior and state changes
2. **Bloc Tests**: Business logic and API integration
3. **Integration Tests**: Complete user workflows
4. **Golden Tests**: UI visual consistency
5. **Performance Tests**: Audio startup (<2s), AI response (<5s)

---

## 6. Development Workflow Learnings

### Task Organization (70 Tasks Total)

#### Phase Structure:
1. **Setup** (T001-T006): Project initialization and permissions
2. **TDD Tests** (T007-T026): All tests written first and failing
3. **Code Generation** (T027): Generate mappers and providers
4. **Routing** (T028-T029): Type-safe navigation
5. **Implementation** (T030-T056): Widgets, utilities, integration
6. **Assembly** (T057-T059): Main app and navigation
7. **Validation** (T060-T062): End-to-end testing
8. **Polish** (T063-T070): Performance, error handling, cleanup

#### Parallelization Insights:
- **45+ tasks marked [P]** for parallel execution
- Feature-based architecture enables maximum parallelization
- Code generation creates natural synchronization points
- Different features = different developers can work simultaneously

### Dependencies That Matter:
- Models before blocs
- Tests before implementation  
- Code generation after model changes
- Core features before integration
- Everything before polish

## 7. Flutter-Specific Insights

### Project Structure Evolution

**Key Learning**: Feature-based structure scales better than layer-based

#### Comparison:
```
❌ Layer-based (Traditional):        ✅ Feature-based (Chosen):
lib/                                 lib/
├── models/                          ├── features/
├── services/                        │   ├── configuration/
├── widgets/                         │   ├── threads/
└── utils/                          │   ├── chat/
                                    │   ├── modes/
                                    │   └── media/
```

#### Benefits of Feature-Based:
- Independent development and testing
- Clear ownership and responsibility
- Easier to add/remove features
- Better code organization as project scales

### Permission Handling Strategy

**Android**: `AndroidManifest.xml` permissions + runtime requests
**iOS**: `Info.plist` usage descriptions + permission_handler

**Key Insight**: Background audio requires special handling
- Android: Foreground service with notification
- iOS: Background audio capability in entitlements
- Graceful degradation when permissions denied

### Code Generation Workflow

**Critical Process**: 
1. Write models with annotations
2. Run `dart run build_runner build`
3. Use generated code in blocs and widgets
4. Re-run generation after model changes

**Build Runner Commands**:
- `build`: One-time generation
- `watch`: Continuous generation during development
- `clean`: Clear generated files

## 8. API Design Patterns

### OpenAI Integration Best Practices

#### Client Configuration:
```dart
final client = OpenAIClient(
  apiKey: config.apiKey,
  baseUrl: config.baseUrl, // Optional for custom APIs
);
```

#### Multi-Modal Message Structure:
```dart
final contentParts = <ChatCompletionMessageContentPart>[
  ChatCompletionMessageContentPart.text(text: userText),
  ChatCompletionMessageContentPart.image(
    imageUrl: ChatCompletionMessageImageUrl(
      url: 'data:image/jpeg;base64,$base64Image',
    ),
  ),
  ChatCompletionMessageContentPart.audio(
    inputAudio: ChatCompletionMessageInputAudio(
      data: base64Audio,
      format: ChatCompletionMessageInputAudioFormat.wav,
    ),
  ),
];
```

#### Error Handling Pattern:
```dart
try {
  final response = await client.createChatCompletion(request);
  // Handle success
} catch (e) {
  // Handle API errors gracefully
  // Update UI state to show error
  // Provide retry mechanism
}
```
