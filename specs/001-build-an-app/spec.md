**Created**: September 15, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build an app with Flutter tech stack featuring OpenAI integration, local storage, thread management, and multi-modal chat input with configurable modes for content generation"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: mobile app users, AI-powered content generation, multi-modal input, thread management, configuration, quick actions with copy/share
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow: setup ‚Üí create threads ‚Üí input content ‚Üí generate AI responses
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (configuration, threads, messages, modes)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to quickly capture and process their thoughts using voice, images, or text input through an AI assistant. They configure the app with their AI service credentials, create conversation threads to organize different topics, and use various modes to generate structured content (specifications, code contexts, or custom outputs) from their multi-modal inputs. The focus is on speed and ease of use, particularly for voice-based thought capture without requiring manual thread naming or complex setup.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the app is first launched, **When** user opens the home screen, **Then** they see configuration fields for AI service URL, API key, model selection, and audio processing options with local storage capability
2. **Given** configuration is completed, **When** user navigates to threads list, **Then** they see an empty list with ability to create new threads and group existing ones
3. **Given** user creates a new thread, **When** they input content via text, voice, or image, **Then** the thread name is auto-generated from the content and the message is stored
4. **Given** user is in a thread, **When** they select a quick action mode (spec, code-context, or custom), **Then** the AI processes all thread content with system prompt and mode-specific user prompt to generate markdown output
5. **Given** AI generates output, **When** user views the result, **Then** they see markdown-formatted content with primary actions to copy or share the output
6. **Given** user wants to customize generation behavior, **When** they access quick actions configuration, **Then** they can create, edit, or duplicate prompt templates for different output types
7. **Given** user has audio transcription enabled, **When** they input voice content, **Then** the system transcribes audio using the configured LLM model before processing with selected modes

### Edge Cases
- What happens when AI service is unreachable or API key is invalid?
- How does the system handle very long voice recordings or large image files?
- What occurs when auto-generating thread names from ambiguous or very brief content?
- How are quick actions handled when duplicating involves default vs custom modes?
- What happens to local data when the app is updated or reinstalled?
- How does copy/share functionality work with very large markdown outputs?
- What happens when sharing fails due to device limitations or app restrictions?
- How does the system handle audio transcription failures when using the same LLM model?
- What occurs when the configured model doesn't support multi-modal audio input for transcription?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a home screen configuration interface for AI service base URL, API key, model name selection, and audio processing options
- **FR-002**: System MUST store all configuration data locally on the device
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate that selected AI model supports both audio and text input capabilities
- **FR-003a**: System MUST provide option to transcribe audio using the same LLM model before processing with selected modes
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to create, view, and organize conversation threads in a list interface
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to group threads with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: grouping criteria - by topic, date, mode, or user-defined categories?]
- **FR-006**: System MUST auto-generate thread names from the first message or context without requiring manual input
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to input content in multiple formats: text, images, and audio recordings
- **FR-008**: System MUST support one-way communication where user provides input and AI generates single responses
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide multiple quick action modes including at minimum: "spec" mode and "code-context" mode
- **FR-010**: System MUST use a default system prompt combined with mode-specific user prompts for AI generation
- **FR-011**: System MUST generate all AI responses in markdown format
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide primary actions to copy and share generated markdown output
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow users to create and configure custom quick action modes with custom prompts
- **FR-014**: System MUST include default quick action modes that cannot be edited but can be duplicated for customization
- **FR-015**: System MUST process all content within a thread when generating responses, not just the latest message
- **FR-016**: System MUST operate entirely offline for local data management with online connectivity only for AI service calls
- **FR-017**: System MUST persist all threads, messages, quick action modes, and configuration locally across app sessions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Configuration**: Stores AI service connection details (base URL, API key, model name, audio processing preferences) with local persistence
- **Thread**: Represents a conversation session with auto-generated name, creation timestamp, optional grouping, and message history
- **Message**: Contains user input content (text, audio file reference, or image file reference) with timestamp and input type
- **Quick Action Mode**: Defines content generation behavior with user prompt template, name, and editability status (default vs custom)
- **System Prompt**: Default prompt template that provides context for all AI interactions
- **Generated Output**: Markdown-formatted AI response with copy and share capabilities
- **Group**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: grouping structure not fully specified - hierarchical, flat tags, or folder-like organization?]
